## Phase 2: Project Dashboard + Trade Setup (Week 2)
**Goal**: PM can create a project, paste 15+ trades from a spreadsheet, see a clean buyout dashboard, and update statuses — all without full page reloads.

### Project List
- [x] Project list view: company-scoped queryset (users only see their company's projects) *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] Project list template: table/cards showing name, number, project type, trade count, link to dashboard *(2026-03-04)*

- [x] Empty state when no trades yet *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] "Import Trades" and "Add Trade" buttons visible on dashboard *(2026-03-04)*

### Trade Import (paste-based)
- [ ] ~~Deferred to post-MVP~~ — manual add is sufficient for pilot. Fuzzy match + confirm flow to be designed carefully before implementation.

### Manual Single-Trade Add
- [x] Trade add form: CSI trade dropdown + budget field *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] Redirect to dashboard after trade created *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] Validation: prevent duplicate CSI trade on same project *(2026-03-04)*

### HTMX Interactions
- [x] Trade status update: status dropdown → hx-post → updates Trade.status → returns updated row *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] Trade PE assignment: PE dropdown → hx-post → updates Trade.assigned_to → returns updated row *(2026-03-04)*

- [ ] ~~`parse_trade_import()` tests~~ — deferred with trade import feature (post-MVP)
- [x] Duplicate CSI trade on same project rejected *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] Trade status update persists correctly *(2026-03-04)*
- [x] Dashboard trade count matches actual Trade records *(2026-03-04)*

---

## Phase 3: Scope Exhibit Editor (Weeks 3–4)
**Goal**: Full editor workflow — pick template → clone → edit sections/items → reorder → indent/outdent. Hierarchical numbering correct after every operation.

### Week 3 — Template picker + clone + basic editor

#### URL & Routing
- [x] Create `exhibits/urls.py` with `app_name = 'exhibits'` — entry flow URLs (open/pick/start) + editor URL + all HTMX section/item endpoints *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Wire `exhibits/` into `scope_manager/urls.py` *(2026-03-05)*

#### Services (`exhibits/services.py`)
- [x] `create_blank_exhibit(trade, user)` — creates exhibit + 5 default sections: General Conditions, Scope of Work, Specific Inclusions, Specific Exclusions, Clarifications & Assumptions *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `clone_exhibit(source_exhibit, trade, user)` — deep-copies all sections and items; two-pass approach: create items with `parent=None` first, then remap parent FKs using old→new pk map *(2026-03-05)*

#### Entry Flow Views
- [x] `trade_scope_open` — checks if exhibit already exists for the trade's `(project, csi_trade)` pair; redirects to editor if found, picker if not *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `template_picker` — lists templates (`is_template=True`) + finalized past exhibits for the same CSI trade, sorted by project type match then date *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `exhibit_start` (POST) — calls clone or create-blank service based on `source` param; sets `trade.status = SCOPE_IN_PROGRESS`; redirects to editor *(2026-03-05)*

#### Template Picker Page
- [x] `templates/exhibits/picker.html` — "Start from Blank" button + company template cards + past exhibit cards; each card has a form that POSTs to `exhibit_start` with `source=<pk>` or `source=blank` *(2026-03-05)*

#### Editor Page
- [x] `exhibit_editor` view — fetches exhibit (company-scoped), prefetches sections with items *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `templates/exhibits/editor.html` — two-column layout: section list (left, ~70%) + placeholder sidebar (right, ~30%); scope description textarea with manual Save button *(2026-03-05)*

#### Section CRUD (HTMX — all return `partials/section_list.html`)
- [x] `partials/section_list.html` + `partials/section.html` — section list is the HTMX swap target (`id="section-list"`); each section shows name, rename/delete/move-up/move-down controls, its item list, and an "Add Item" button *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `section_add` view — appends new section at end; returns section list *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `section_rename` view — updates section name; returns section list *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `section_delete` view — deletes section (cascade removes items); returns section list *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `section_move` view — reads `direction` param (up/down), swaps `order` with adjacent section; returns section list *(2026-03-05)*

#### Item CRUD (HTMX — target is item list within a section, `id="items-<section_pk>"`)
- [x] `partials/item.html` + `partials/item_form.html` — display mode shows text + Edit/Delete buttons; edit mode shows textarea + Save/Cancel *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `item_add` view — creates top-level item (`level=0`, `parent=None`) at end of section; returns section's item list *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `item_edit` view — GET returns edit form partial; POST saves text and returns display partial (outerHTML swap on `#item-<pk>`) *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `item_delete` view — recursively collects item + all descendants, deletes all; returns section's item list *(2026-03-05)*

#### Wiring
- [x] Update `trade_row.html` "Open Scope →" link to `{% url 'exhibits:trade_scope_open' trade.project.pk trade.pk %}` *(2026-03-05)*

### Week 4 — Hierarchy + polish

#### URL Additions
- [x] Add 5 new patterns to `exhibits/urls.py`: `item_move`, `item_indent`, `item_outdent`, `exhibit_save_as_template`, `exhibit_update_status` *(2026-03-05)*

#### Hierarchical Numbering
- [x] `compute_section_numbering(section)` in `services.py` — builds item tree in memory, recursively assigns number strings (`1`, `1.1`, `1.1.1`); returns `{item_pk: "1.2.3"}` dict *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `exhibits/templatetags/exhibit_tags.py` — `get_item` filter so templates can do `{{ numbers|get_item:item.pk }}` *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Update `_item_list_response` and `_section_list_response` in `views.py` to call `compute_section_numbering` and pass `numbers` dict to templates *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Update `item.html` to display the hierarchical number prefix before item text *(2026-03-05)*

#### Item Reordering
- [x] `item_move` view — finds siblings (same `parent` + same `section`), swaps `order` with adjacent sibling in given direction; subtree follows for free since children are always rendered under their parent; returns item list *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Add ↑ / ↓ buttons to `item.html` (visible on hover, alongside Edit/Delete) *(2026-03-05)*

#### Item Indent / Outdent
- [x] `indent_item(item)` in `services.py` — finds previous sibling; sets `item.parent = previous_sibling`, `item.level += 1`, appends to end of new parent's children; cascades `level += 1` to all descendants via `bulk_update` *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `outdent_item(item)` in `services.py` — sets `item.parent = item.parent.parent` (may be `None`), `item.level -= 1`, appends to end of new sibling group; cascades `level -= 1` to all descendants via `bulk_update` *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `item_indent` and `item_outdent` views — call the respective service functions; return item list for the section *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Add → (indent) and ← (outdent) buttons to `item.html` (visible on hover) *(2026-03-05)*

#### Save-as-Template
- [x] `save_as_template(source_exhibit, user)` in `services.py` — reuses clone logic with `is_template=True`, `project=None` *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] `exhibit_save_as_template` view (POST) — calls service, redirects to original exhibit's editor with a success flash message *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Add "Save as Template" button to editor header *(2026-03-05)*

#### Exhibit Status Transitions
- [x] `exhibit_update_status` view (POST) — validates status value; updates `exhibit.status`; syncs trade status: `READY_FOR_BID` → trade `OUT_TO_BID`, `FINALIZED` → trade `SUBCONTRACT_ISSUED` (never regresses trade status); trade looked up via `(exhibit.project, exhibit.csi_trade)` *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Replace static status badge in `editor.html` header with a `<select>` form that auto-submits on change to `exhibit_update_status` *(2026-03-05)*

#### Integration Tests (`exhibits/tests.py`)
- [x] Service tests: `create_blank_exhibit` (5 sections), `clone_exhibit` (parent FK remapping), `save_as_template` (`is_template=True`, `project=None`) *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Entry flow tests: `trade_scope_open` redirects correctly; `exhibit_start` sets trade to `SCOPE_IN_PROGRESS`; company isolation (404 for other company's exhibit) *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Section CRUD tests: add, rename, delete (cascades items), move (order swaps correctly) *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Item CRUD tests: add, edit, delete with descendants *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Item reorder tests: up/down swaps correct siblings; first/last item no-ops *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Indent/outdent tests: correct parent + level after indent; correct parent + level after outdent; descendants cascade level change *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Numbering tests: `compute_section_numbering` returns correct strings for flat and nested structures *(2026-03-05)*
- [x] Status transition tests: trade status synced at `READY_FOR_BID` and `FINALIZED`; other transitions leave trade unchanged *(2026-03-05)*

- [x] No interactive styles — ink-safe black/dark-gray output *(2026-03-05)*

### WeasyPrint Service (`exports/services.py`)
- [x] `generate_exhibit_pdf(exhibit)`: fetches sections → DFS flatten + numbering per section → `render_to_string()` → `weasyprint.HTML(...).write_pdf()` → returns bytes *(2026-03-05)*

---

## Phase 5: Notes & Cross-Trade Tracking (Week 5–6)
**Goal**: Notes appear in all relevant trade contexts. Open question count accurate. Dashboard shows open question count.

> Note model already exists from Phase 1 — building UI only.

### URL & Routing
- [x] Create `notes/urls.py` with `app_name = 'notes'` — all note endpoints *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] Wire `notes/` into `scope_manager/urls.py` *(2026-03-06)*

### Note Creation (HTMX — from scope editor sidebar)
- [x] `NoteForm` (ModelForm): fields — `text`, `note_type`, `primary_trade`, `related_trades` (checkboxes), `source`; all trade fields filtered to project's trades *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `note_add` view (POST): validates form, saves Note with `project` + `created_by`; returns refreshed `note_list` partial *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `partials/note_form.html`: compact inline form; related trades in collapsible `<details>`; `hx-post` → `note_add` → swap `#notes-list` *(2026-03-06)*

### Notes Sidebar in Scope Editor
- [x] `note_list` view (GET): cross-trade queryset — `primary_trade = trade OR trade in related_trades`; ordered OPEN first *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `partials/note_list.html`: wraps add form + note cards; `id="notes-list"` is HTMX swap target; empty state *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `partials/note_card.html`: type badge color-coded (yellow/blue/gray/green); source, resolution block, inline resolve form in `<details>`, Edit button *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] Editor right panel updated: replaces Phase 5 placeholder; guards against template exhibits (no project) *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `exhibit_editor` view: passes `notes` (cross-trade Q filter) and `form` (NoteForm) on initial load *(2026-03-06)*

### Note Resolution (HTMX)
- [x] `note_resolve` view (POST): sets `status`, `resolution`, `resolved_by`, `resolved_at`; returns `note_card.html` or empty response when `dismiss=1` (open questions page) *(2026-03-06)*

### Note Edit (HTMX)
- [x] `note_edit` view (GET/POST): GET returns edit form; `?cancel=1` returns card; POST saves and returns updated card *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `partials/note_edit_form.html`: pre-populated form; related trades auto-checked; Cancel → restore card *(2026-03-06)*

### Project-Level Open Questions View
- [x] `open_questions` view (GET): filters `OPEN_QUESTION + OPEN` for the project; company-scoped 404 *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] `templates/notes/open_questions.html`: yellow-bordered cards with trade info, age, "Open scope →" link, inline resolve form; resolved items collapse out via `dismiss=1` *(2026-03-06)*

### Open Questions Badge on Buyout Dashboard
- [x] `project_dashboard` view: counts `OPEN_QUESTION + OPEN` notes, passes `open_question_count` to template *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] Dashboard header: yellow badge button with count linking to open questions page; hidden when count is zero *(2026-03-06)*

### Tests (`notes/tests.py`) — 20 tests, all passing
- [x] Note creation: M2M related_trades saved, project + created_by set correctly *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] Cross-trade visibility: primary and related trade notes appear; unrelated notes excluded *(2026-03-06)*
- [x] Company isolation: note_list, note_resolve, open_questions all return 404 for wrong company *(2026-03-06)*

- [x] Auth guards: all endpoints redirect unauthenticated users *(2026-03-06)*

---

## Phase 6: AI Scope Assistant (Week 6–7)
**Goal**: Both AI functions work end-to-end. Failures degrade gracefully. PM can complete any exhibit with or without AI.

> `AI_ENABLED` flag and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are already in settings. `ai_services/` app already exists — building the service layer and UI on top.

### AIRequestLog Model
- [x] Add `AIRequestLog` model to `ai_services/models.py` with fields: `request_type` (SCOPE_FROM_DESCRIPTION or SCOPE_ITEM), `exhibit` (FK → ScopeExhibit, nullable), `success` (boolean), `error_message` (text, blank), `tokens_used` (int, nullable), `latency_ms` (int, nullable), `created_at` *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Register `AIRequestLog` in `ai_services/admin.py` *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Generate and apply migration *(2026-03-08)*

### AI Service Layer (`ai_services/services.py`)
- [x] Install `anthropic` package (`pip install anthropic`) and verify it's importable *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Write a shared `_call_claude(system_prompt, user_prompt)` helper: retries once on 5xx errors, returns the text response or raises a clear exception; logs every call to `AIRequestLog` (success/failure, tokens, latency) *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Write `generate_scope_from_description(exhibit)`: builds user prompt with trade, project type, description, scope description, and existing sections; asks Claude to return structured JSON; returns the parsed dict *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Write `generate_scope_item(input_text, exhibit, section)`: sends the PM's plain-language note plus trade/section context; asks Claude to rewrite as a single polished exhibit line; returns the standardized text string *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Write `_parse_json_response(text)`: strips markdown fences, wraps `json.loads()` with try/except; returns `None` on failure *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Both functions check `settings.AI_ENABLED` first and raise `AIDisabledError` if the flag is off *(2026-03-08)*

### Editor Integration 1 — "Generate Scope" (full exhibit from description)
- [x] Add a "Generate Scope" button to `editor.html` — visible only when `AI_ENABLED` is True and `exhibit.scope_description` is not empty *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Write `exhibit_generate_scope` view: calls `generate_scope_from_description(exhibit)`; matches sections by name (case-insensitive); bulk-creates `ScopeItem` records with `is_ai_generated=True`; returns refreshed `section_list` partial *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Show loading spinner on the button while HTMX request is in flight (`hx-indicator`) *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] On AI failure, return section list unchanged with a Django flash message *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Add URL for this view in `exhibits/urls.py` *(2026-03-08)*

### Editor Integration 2 — Per-Section Item Generation
- [x] Add "Ask AI…" input to each section's footer in `section.html` — visible only when `AI_ENABLED` is True *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Write `item_generate` view: calls `generate_scope_item()`, creates a `ScopeItem` with `is_ai_generated=True`; falls back to raw input text on AI failure *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] Add URL for this view in `exhibits/urls.py` *(2026-03-08)*

### Feature Flag Guard
- [x] All AI UI elements wrapped in `{% if ai_enabled %}` in `editor.html` and `section.html` *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `ai_enabled` passed from `exhibit_editor` view context and `_section_list_response` helper *(2026-03-08)*

### Tests (`ai_services/tests.py`) — all with mocked API, no real calls
- [x] `generate_scope_from_description()` returns correctly structured dict when API returns valid JSON *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `generate_scope_from_description()` returns `None` gracefully when API returns malformed JSON *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `generate_scope_item()` returns a cleaned string when API responds correctly *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `_call_claude()` retries once on a simulated 5xx error then succeeds *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `_call_claude()` logs a failed `AIRequestLog` record when all retries fail *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `exhibit_generate_scope` view creates `ScopeItem` records with `is_ai_generated=True` *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `exhibit_generate_scope` view skips unmatched section names *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] `item_generate` view falls back to raw input on AI failure *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] All AI views return 404 for another company's exhibit (company isolation) *(2026-03-08)*
- [x] With `AI_ENABLED=False`, both service functions raise `AIDisabledError` *(2026-03-08)*

---

## Phase 7: Final Review + Hardening + Launch (Weeks 7–8)

### Week 7: Final Review
- [ ] Review generation service: open notes check, cross-trade notes check, checklist items check
